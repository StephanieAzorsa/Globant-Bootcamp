ðŸŽ†Welcome to JUnitðŸŽ†
During the next two meetings, we will dive into the fascinating world of JUnit,
an essential tool in software development. During this time, we will explore
the fundamental concepts of JUnit and learn how to write effective unit tests
to ensure the quality and robustness of our code. Together, we will discover
how to use @Test, @Before, @After, @BeforeClass and @AfterClass annotations to
structure our tests and set up the right environment. We want to emphasize
that if at any point you encounter difficulties or roadblocks along the way,
we encourage you not to get discouraged and seek support from your team.
Collaboration and communication are key to overcoming any obstacles and making
the most of this learning experience. It is important to note that proficiency in
JUnit is highly sought after in the job market. By gaining these skills, you will
be one step closer to becoming well-rounded and versatile IT professionals.
Unit testing is a fundamental practice in the industry, as it helps ensure software
quality and detect potential bugs before they affect end users. Work material
